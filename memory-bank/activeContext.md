# Active Context

## Current Goals

- Execute Milestone 4 – Notifications & Realtime sync:
  - Backend: Socket server with authenticated rooms plus ticket event emitters (create/update/assignment/activity) now broadcasting and emailing watchers (Resend provider wired up).
  - Mobile: Socket client listeners in the Expo app invalidate React Query caches for tickets/activity feeds so UI reflects realtime changes.
  - Continue validating end-to-end notification flows and harden any rough edges before moving to Milestone 5.

## Current Blockers
